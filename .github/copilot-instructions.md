# Copilot Instructions

## General Guidelines

You are assisting a university student in developing a vanilla web application that facilitates language learning. Ask clarifying questions for vague requests like "clear all data" or "add a reset button" before implementing changes but proceed directly if the intention is clear. Then, explain the changes you've made so that even students without technical backgrounds can understand.

Read `README.md` and the full content of all listed HTML, CSS and JavaScript files well before implementation. If you can't access them by yourself, stop and ask the student to attach them by dragging them to the chat area.

This application runs directly by opening `index.html` in a browser - no build step required. Maintain this simplicity in all modifications.

## Code Standards

### All Files
- Use tabs for indentation.

### HTML
- Name IDs and classes in kebab-case.
- Do not include any CSS or JavaScript code directly within HTML.

### CSS
- Use `rem` units instead of `px` for responsive design.
- Avoid adding prefixes like `-webkit-` and `-moz-` to properties.
- Leverage modern CSS features like nesting, `@starting-style` and custom properties.
  Follow the official CSS nesting specification, not SCSS syntax. Specifically, the parent selector is implicitly wrapped with `:is()`, and affixing class names (e.g. `&-active`) is not supported.
- Use `transition: display 0.3s allow-discrete` to keep the visibility in sync with other transitions like `opacity`. Never set the visibility manually after a delay by `setTimeout` in JavaScript.

### JavaScript
- Name variables, constants and functions in camelCase.
- Use full, descriptive variable names instead of abbreviations (e.g. `index` instead of `i`, `event` instead of `e`).
- Use modern ECMAScript features:
  - Optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`, `??=`)
  - `Object.groupBy(items, item => item.key)` for array grouping
  - `array.at(-1)` for last element access
  - `for...of` loops over `.forEach()` (Use `.entries()` if index is required)
  - `async/await` over promise chains
- DOM manipulation:
  - Use `.textContent` over `.innerHTML`.
  - Use `.hidden` property for visibility, not `.style.display`.
  - Use `.classList` over `.className` for CSS class management.
  - Use `.addEventListener()` over `.on*` properties, e.g.:
    ```js
    function blobToBase64(blob) {
    	const { promise, resolve, reject } = Promise.withResolvers();
    	const reader = new FileReader();
    	reader.addEventListener("load", () => resolve(reader.result));
    	reader.addEventListener("error", reject);
    	reader.readAsDataURL(blob);
    	return promise;
    }
    ```
  - Create elements with `document.createElement()` (and `document.createTextNode()` where appropriate).
  - Define CSS classes in the stylesheet and apply them using `.classList`. Avoid inlining styles via the `.style` property.
- Create JavaScript files as ES modules and import them using relative paths with the `.js` extension in other JavaScript modules, not in HTML.
- Import libraries as ES modules directly from CDNs when needed, e.g.:
  ```js
  import { openDB } from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/idb/+esm";
  ```
  Do not specify the version number.
- Prefer function declarations for named functions, arrow functions for inline use.
- Omit parentheses for arrow functions with a single parameter.
- Use `catch {` instead of `catch (_) {` for unused error parameters.
- Avoid self-explanatory comments. Comment on intentions, not obvious implementations.
- Place related functionality nearby.

## Project-Specific Instructions

### HTML
- Place all visible elements within `main`.
- Maintain the existing grid layout structure of `main`.
- Use IDs that correspond to dataset fields in `#card`.
- Remove unused elements within `.card-front` and `.card-back` whenever there are fields update (e.g. when `renderCard` in JavaScript is modified).
- For elements with dynamic visibility, apply `transition-*` CSS class(es) for smooth entry/exit animations.
- For elements hidden by default, add the `hidden` attribute.

### JavaScript
- Remove `posMapping` when modifying `renderCard` if you found it's irrelevant to the student's project goal.
